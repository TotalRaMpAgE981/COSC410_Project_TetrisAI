# COSC410 Project: Tetris clone and AI
This is an independent project I did for my AI course. It is a console based Tetris clone and somewhat good AI that can get high scores. The score system is not the same and I finished before reading up on the actual score system of Tetris; it promotes combos instead of quad clears.
